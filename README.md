# gmail-deleter
 a mass e-mail deleter in python made by Herbert Cardozo (I'm a begginer)

 This script requires access to your gmail account through authenticantion on Gmail API

 1. Download your credentials on the dashboard and save them in the same folder as
 credentials.json

 The first time this script runs it will create a token.pickle file to use for
 authentication

2. The input accepts query values used in gmail, such as from:, to:, in: and is:
and parses it to fetch a list of all messages corresponding to the query.

3. A prompt asks for confirmation for the mass deletion of the e-mails.

4. The e-mails are permanently deleted. They don't go to the thrash bin. CAUTION!!

5. Use it at you own volition. I take no responsabilities for any mistakes made.
